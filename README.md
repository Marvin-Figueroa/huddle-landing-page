This is my solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
